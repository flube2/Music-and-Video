How to recover your lost/damaged media files from online


If you have bought some kind of media and no longer have access to them due to corruption or loss of data, you may wish to recover them via online resources. If you find them online and wish to download as an audio and/or video file then follow the steps below. 

*Note: This is intended for media you have legal access to such as you found songs on YouTube from a CD you bought, but is too scratched to be read. Or you bought a movie and accidentally rm'd it on Linux (it happens to all of us, sorry for your loss), but found it from some online streaming source. I am not responsible for misuse and I do not have any affiliation with the companies whose products I've linked.*

1. Download Torch Browser: https://torchbrowser.com
2. Install Torch Browser. Read all checkbox options where applicable. It's free.
3. Immediately upon opening torch:

   + Go to torch://extensions and disable all, *especially* Torch Shopping. **Trust me, you want to do this first.**
   + Go to torch://settings and (non vital):
      + Disble TorchMe for New Tab
      + On startup: Continue where I left off
      + Privacy and Security: Send Do Not Track Request --> On
      + Privacy and Security: Review all "Content Settings"
      + Passwords and Forms: Offer to save passwords --> Off
   + Go to torch://settings and (important):
      + Downloads: Ask where to save each file before downloading --> On
      + Download Accelerator: On with 8 Connections
      + Media Grabber: Show a menu
      
4. Browse to the media source using Torch, for example https://youtu.be/LIiLoT4Po-c
5. Click on the button to the right of the navigation bar that looks like an arrow pointing to an upside down staple and select the download format (just video file or video and audio files) and location. *Note: there is no need to wait for the video or audio to buffer before downloading it. Another benefit.* 

Video:

6. Open video in compatible application after download completes.

Audio Files (Single / Multiple):

6. Navigate to an online conversion website: https://online-audio-converter.com/ It's also free.
7. Here you select all files, desired format, and I always use the highest quality I can, then click convert.
8. Download and extract zip file.
9. Open audio in compatible application after download completes.

*Note: There was some reason that I didn't use the conversion website's "Edit Track Info" option. Either it wasn't in depth enough for my liking or it didn't work for multiple files. Once converted, if you want metadata attached, unfortunately you have to do this manually because Torch doesn't add metadata upon downloading. But tell me a way where you won't have to do this manually. Plus, it's a good weekend project to listen to a few albums and add titles, artist, track info, discover new songs and artists and expand your knowledge of the world of music.*


Repeat steps 4 and 5 to obtain desired files.
Repeat steps 6+ to obtain correct format and open desired files.


***As Torch is built off of Chrome, it is still suggested and wise to use it only over a VPN for downloading these files and not to use for your typical browsing as, in the end, it is still a Google product. What's wrong with Google? See step 4 (I am not responsible for nausea induced by the video)***
